    <h1>Emmanuel Ihezie</h1>
    <p>I am a student of the University of Lagos studying Adult Education with a vision to be work class. <br>
    I have always wanted to be a tech bro which feels cool because it is a new trend but guess what, there are more to what 
    the title of TECH BRO entails.</p>
    <p>I joined the Genesys program to give myself a start and I love the feeling already. I have been able to 
        understand the role of a text editor in making my codes come to live as well as the many tags necessary for building 
        a web page.
    </p>
    <p>I expect to learn more than the web development basics, i want to improve my problem solving skills as well 
        as collaborating with other participants and landing my dream job, giving back to the community.</p>
